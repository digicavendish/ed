#### TO THE LADY MARCHIONESS OF NEWCASTLE, On her Book of EPISTLES.

When all Epistlers you have read, and seek,   
Who writ in Latin, English, French, or Greek,   
Such Woful things, as they are only fit   
To stop Mustard-pots, to this Ladie's Wit,   
Nay, were they all Alive, I Swear, I think   
They'd Burn their Books, and Throw away their Ink,   
Make Pick-Tooths of their Pens, and for their Paper,   
Only to light Tobacco, and each Taper;   
Y'have Spoil'd Commerce, Intelligencers, Trade,   
None now dares write a Letter, so Afraid   
To be thought Fools, and is the Carriers Curse,   
To find his Empty Budget, and Lank Purse,   
Nay the Post-house's Ruin'd, and will Complain,   
From their Vast Gettings now they have no Gain;   
All now by Word of Mouth, and what is spoken,   
Or Gilded Nutmegs, or each Tavern-token,   
Nick'd Sticks for Merchants, Why would you Undo  
Your self at once thus, and the whole World too?   
After my Hearty Commendations, This,   
The Style of States-men still Applauded is;  
Your Flames of Wit, this Age may think a Sin,   
A Proclamation then may call it in.   

##### W. NEWCASTLE.

#### TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD MARQUESS OF NEWCASTLE.

MY LORD,  
It may be said to me, as one said to a Lady, Work Lady, Work, let writing Books alone, For surely Wiser Women ne'r writ one; But your Lordship never bid me to Work, nor leave Writing, except when you would perswade me to spare so much time from my Study as to take the Air for my Health; the truth is, My Lord, I cannot Work, I mean such Works as Ladies use to pass their Time withall, and if I could, the Materials of such Works would cost more than the Work would be worth, besides all the Time and Pains bestow'd upon it. You may ask me, what Works I mean; I answer, Needle-works, Spinning-works, Preserving-works, as also Baking, and Cooking-works, as making Cakes, Pyes, Puddings, and the like, all which I am Ignorant of; and as I am Ignorant in these Imployments, so I am Ignorant in Gaming, Dancing, and Revelling; But yet, I must ask you leave to say, that I am not a Dunce in all Imployments, for I Understand the Keeping of Sheep, and Ordering of a Grange, indifferently well, although I do not Busie my self much with it, by reason my Scribling takes away the most part of my Time. Perchance some may say, that if my Understanding be most of Sheep, and a Grange, it is a Beastly Understanding; My answer is, I wish Men were as Harmless as most Beasts are, then surely the World would be more Quiet and Happy than it is, for then there would not be such Pride, Vanity, Ambition, Covetousness, Faction, Treachery, and Treason, as is now; Indeed one might very well say in his Prayers to God, O Lord God, I beseech thee of thy Infinite Mercy, make Man so, and order his Mind, Thoughts, Passions, and Appetites, like Beasts, that they may be Temperate, Sociable, Laborious, Patient, Prudent, Provident, Brotherly-loving, and Neighbourly-kind, all which Beasts are, but most Men not. But leaving most Men to Beasts, I return to your Lordship, who is one of the Best of men, whom God hath fill'd with Heroick Fortitude, Noble Generosity, Poetical Wit, Moral Honesty, Natural Love, Neighbourly-kindness, Great Patience, Loyal Duty, and Celestial Piety, and I pray God as Zealously and Earnestly to Bless you with Perfect Health and Long Life, as becomes

#### TO ALL PROFESSORS OF Learning and Art.

Most Famously Learned,  
I Wish I could Write so Wisely, Wittily, Eloquently, and Methodically, as might be Worthy of your Perusal; but if any of your Noble Profession should Humble themselves so Low as to Read my Works, or part of them, I pray Consider my Sex and Breeding, and they will fully Excuse those Faults which must Unavoidably be found in my Works. But although I have no Learning, yet give me leave to Admire it, and to wish I were one of your Society, for certainly, were I Emperess of the World, I would Advance those that have most Learning and Wit, by which I believe the Earth would rather be an Heaven, since both Men and Government would be as Celestial, for I am Confident that Wisdom, and for the most part Virtue, is Inherent in those that are Masters of Learning, and Indued with Wit; And to this sort of Persons I do Offer my Works, although to be Condemned on the Altar of their Censure, and rest Satisfied with the Honour that they thought them Worthy to be Iudged. Thus, whether my Works Live or Dye, I am Devoted to be

#### THE PREFACE.

Noble Readers,  
I Hope you will not make the Mistake of a Word a Crime in my Wit, as some former Readers have done, for in my Poems they found Fault that the Number was not Just, nor every Line Matched with a Perfect Rime; But I can answer for that Book, that there be but some such Errors in it, and those as it were by Chance; besides, in some Languages, as Latin and Greek, which are accounted the Chief, they regard not Rimes in their Poems, but only an Exact number of Feet and Measures; however Rimes and Numbers are only as the Garments, and not as the Body of Wit; but I have been more Exact in my other Book call'd Natural Descriptions, wherein most Verses are Just both for Number and Rimes. As for my Work, The World's Olio, they may say some Words are not Exactly Placed, which I confess to be very likely, and not only in that, but in all the rest of my Works there may be such Errors, for I was not Bred in an University, or a Free-School, to Learn the Art of Words; neither do I take it for a Disparagement of my Works, to have the Forms, Terms, Words, Numbers, or Rymes found Fault with, so they do not find Fault with the Variety of the Subjects, or the Sense and Reason, Wit, and Fancy, for I leave the Formal, or Worditive part to Fools, and the Material or Sensitive part to Wise men. Concerning my Philosophical Opinions, some did say, they were too Obscure, and not Plain Enough for their Understanding; I must confess, I writ that Book at first at the same time when I wrote my Poems, but to my Reason it was as Plain as I could write it, and if some Readers could not Understand it, I am not Nature to give them Wit and Understanding; yet have I since not only Over-viewed, and Reformed that Book, but made a great Addition to it, so that I believe, I have now so clearly Declared my Sense and Meaning therein, that those which Understand it not must not only be Irrational, but Insensible Creatures. As for my Book of Playes, some find Fault they are not made up Exactly, nor the Scenes placed Justly, as also I have not in some Playes caused all the Actors to be of an Acquaintance, but this same Fault they find, I have Express'd in one of the Epistles before that Book, which they fling back upon my Work. As for my Orations, I have heard, that some do Censure me for speaking too Freely, and Patronizing Vice too much, but I would have them not to be too Rash in Judging, but to Consider, first, whether there be a sufficient Reason that may move them to give such a Censure, for truly I am as much an Enemy to Vice, as I am a Friend to Virtue, & do Persecute Vice with as perfect an Hatred, as I do Pursue Virtue, with an Intire, and Pure Love, which is Sufficiently Known to those that Know me; and therefore, it is not out of Love to Vice that I Plead for it, but only to Exercise my Fancy, for surely the Wisest, and Eloquentest Orators, have not been Ashamed to Defend Vices upon such Accounts, and why may not I do the like? for my Orations for the most part are Declamations, wherein I speak Pro and Con, and Determine nothing; and as for that Part which contains several Pleadings, it is Fit and Lawful that both Parties should bring in their Arguments as well as they can, to make their Cases Good; but I matter not their Censure, for it would be an Endless Trouble to me, to Answer every ones Foolish Exception; an Horse of a Noble Spirit Slights the Bawling of a Petty Cur, and so do I. As for the Present Book of Letters, I know not as yet what Aspersion they will lay upon it, but I fear they'l say, they are not written in a Modestyle, that is, in a Complementing, and Romancical way, with High Words, and Mystical Expressions, as most of our Modern Letter-writers use to do; But, Noble Readers, I do not intend to Present you here with Long Complements in Short Letters, but with Short Descriptions in Long Letters; the truth is, they are rather Scenes than Letters, for I have Endeavoured under the Cover of Letters to Express the Humors of Mankind, and the Actions of Man's Life by the Correspondence of two Ladies, living at some Short Distance from each other, which make it not only their Chief Delight and Pastime, but their Tye in Friendship, to Discourse by Letters, as they would do if they were Personally together, so that these Letters are an Imitation of a Personal Visitation and Conversation, which I think is Better (I am sure more Profitable) than those Conversations that are an Imitation of Romancical Letters, which are but Empty Words, and Vain Complements. But the Reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is, first, that I have put forth Twenty Playes already, which number I thought to be Sufficient, next, I saw that Variety of Forms did Please the Readers best, and that lastly they would be more taken with the Brevity of Letters, than the Formality of Scenes, and whole Playes, whose Parts and Plots cannot be Understood till the whole Play be Read over, whereas a Short Letter will give a Full Satisfaction of what they Read. And thus I thought this to be the Best Way or Form to put this Work into, which if you Approve of, I have my Reward.

#### UPON HER EXCELLENCY THE AUTHORESS.

This Lady only to her self she Writes,     
And all her Letters to her self Indites;     
For in her self so many Creatures be,     
Like many Commonwealths, yet all Agree.     
Man's Head's a World, where Thoughts are Born and Bred,      
And Reason's Emperour in every Head;      
But in all Heads doth not a Caesar Reign,    
A Wise Augustus hath not every Brain,     
And Reason in some Brains from Rule's put out.      
By Mad, Rebellious Thoughts, and Factious Rout;     
And Great Disorder in such Brains will be,     
Not any Thought with Reason will Agree;     
But in her Brain doth Reason Govern well,     
Not any Thought 'gainst Reason doth Rebell,     
But doth Obey what Reason doth Command,     
When 'tis his Will, doth Travel Sea and Land,     
As some do Travel out to Kingdomes far,     
And Guided are by Observation's Star,     
They bring Intelligence from every State,     
Their Peace, their Wars, their Factions, and their Hate,     
And into every City Travel free,     
Relate their Customs, Trafficks, Policy,     
Observe each Magistrate, their Formal Face,     
And what Authority they bear, or Place,      
Whether they Covetously do Extort,     
Or are Ambitious, giving Bribes at Court,     
To Raise to Places, or to Hide their Crime,     
For thus Men do to Wealth and Office Clime;   
And some into the Churches go to see   
Who Kneels in Pray'r, or comes for Company,   
Who Courts his Mistress as his only Saint,   
Implores her Favour, and makes his Complaint   
Be Known, Or who doth turn her eyes about,   
To shew her Face, or seek a Lover out;   
And some to Balls, and Masks, and Playes do go,   
And some do Crowd to see a Pagan Shew,   
And some within Kings Courts do get a Place,   
Observe the Grandeur, and the Courtly Grace,   
The Ceremony and Splendor of a Court,   
Their Playes, Balls, Masks, and every several Sport,   
And all their Amorous Courtships which they make,   
And how the Ladies do each Courtship take,   
The Antick Postures of the Younger Race,   
Their Mimick Gestures, and Affected Pace,   
Their Amorous Smiles, and Glancing Wanton Eyes,   
All which do Noble Souls Hate and Despise;   
And some amongst the Privy-Counsel get,   
Where round a Table Prince and Nobles sit,   
Hear what they say, Observe their Cross Debates,   
And mark which speaks through Faction, or which Hates   
Some Lord that is in Favour more than he,   
For in States Matters seldom they Agree.   
And thus Her Thoughts, the Creatures of her Mind,   
Do Travel through the World amongst Mankind,   
And then Return, and to the Mind do bring  
All the Relations of each several thing;   
And Observation Guides them back again   
To Reason, their Great King, that's in the Brain:   
Then Contemplation calls the Senses straight,   
Which Ready are, and Diligently Wait,   
Commanding Two these Letters for to Write,   
Touch in the Hand, as also the Eye-sight,   
These Two the Soul's Clerks are, which do Inscribe,   
And Write all Truly down, having no Bribe.

#### TO THE CENSORIOUS READER.

Reader, you'l think, perchance, my Wit in Fault,       
Like Meat that's too much Brin'd, and Oversalt,     
But better Poets far than I have been,   
Have written Sharper, and with Greater Splene,     
Yet they have much been Prais'd for writing so,     
And on Advancing Stigues of Fame do go;   
But my Poor Writings they no Malice know,   
Nor on a Crabbed Nature did they Grow;   
I to Particulars give no Abuse,   
My Wit Indites for Profitable Use,   
That Men may see their Follies, and their Crimes,   
Their Errours, Vanities, and Idle Times,   
Not that I think they do not Know them well,   
But lest they should Forget, Im' Bold to tell,   
For to Remember them, like those that Ride,   
Not thinking, on their Way, may chance to Slide,   
Or Fall into a Ditch, so I for Fear   
Bid them take Heed, Beware, and have a Care,   
For there are Stumps of Trees, or a Deep Pit,   
Or Dangerous Passages where Thieves do sit   
And Wait, or Ravenous Beasts do lye for Prey,   
Or such a Lane where's Foul and Dirty Way,   
And so of Waters, and each Dangerous place:   
But I write not to any mans Disgrace;   
Then Censure not my Satyr-wit for Crime,   
Nor putting this Epistle into Rime.

### Sociable Letters 

###### I.

MADAM,  
You were pleas'd to desire, that, since we cannot converse Personally, we should converse by Letters, so as if we were speaking to each other, discoursing our Opinions, discovering our Designs, asking and giving each other Advice, also telling the several Accidents, and several Imployments of our home-affairs, and what visits we receive, or entertainments we make, and whom we visit, and how we are entertaind, what discourses we have in our gossiping-meetings, and what reports we hear of publick affairs, and of particular Persons, and the like; so that our Letters may present our personal meetings and associatings. Truly, Madam, I take so much delight in your wise, witty, and virtuous Conversation, as I could not pass my life more pleasing 2 and delightfully; wherefore I am never better pleased, than when I am reading your Letters, and when I am writing Letters to you; for my mind and thoughts are all that while in your Company: the truth is, my mind and thoughts live alwayes with you, although my person is at distance from you; insomuch, as, if Souls die not as Bodies do, my Soul will attend you when my Body lies in the grave; and when we are both dead, we may hope to have a Conversation of Souls, where yours and mine will be doubly united, first in Life, and then in Death, in which I shall eternally be,

Madam,   
Your faithful Friend and humble Servant.

###### II.

MADAM,  
The Lady C. E. ought not to be reproved for grieving for the loss of her Beauty, for Beauty is the Light of our Sex, which is Eclips'd in Middle age, and Benighted in Old age, wherein our Sex sits in Melancholy Darkness, and the remembrance of Beauty past, is as a displeasing Dream. The truth is, a young beautiful face is a Friend, when as an old withered face is an Enemy, the one causes Love, the other Aversion: yet I am not of Mrs. U. R.'s. humour, which had 3 rather dye before her Beauty, than that her Beauty should die before her: for I had rather live with wrinkles, than die with youth; and had rather my face cloth'd with Time's sad mourning, than with Death's white hue; and surely it were better to follow the shadow of Beauty, than that Beauty should go with the Corps to the Grave; and I believe that Mrs. V. R. would do, as the tale is of a woman, that did wish, and pray she might die before her Husband, but when Death came, she intreated him to spare her, and take her Husband; so that she would rather live without him, than die for him. But leaving this sad discourse of Age, Wrinkles, Ruin and Death, I rest,

Madam,   
Your very faithful Friend, and Servant.

###### III.

MADAM,  
I Do not wonder, there are great factions between the three families C. Y. O. by reason they have no business, or imployment to busie their heads about, and their servants & followers have as little to do, which makes them censure, backbite, and envy each other; for Idleness and Poverty are the creators of Faction, and Pride 4 and Ambition the disturbers of Peace. Wherefore Idleness should be banish'd out of every family, which will also be a means to be rid of Poverty, for Industry is the way to thrive: Besides, when men have something to do, they will have the less time to talk; for many words from discontented persons increase hate, and make dissentions: the truth is, words for the most part make more discord than union, and more enemies than friends; wherefore Silence is more commendable than much Speaking, for the liberty of the tongue doth rather express men's follies, than make known their wit; neither do many words argue much Judgement; but as the old Saying is, The greatest talkers are the least actors, they being more apt to speak spitefully, than to act mischievously; another Saying is, That musing men rather study to do evil, than contemplate on good; But I am not of that opinion, for if men would think more, and speak less, the world of mankind would be more honest and wiser than they are, for Thoughts beget Consideration, Consideration begets Judgement, Judgement begets Discretion, Discretion begets Temperance, and Temperance begets Peace in the Mind, and Health in the Body, for when men want Temperance, they are subject to Insatiable Appetites, unruly Passions, and wandring Desires, which causes Covetousness and Ambition, and these cause Envy and Hate, which makes Faction and Strife, which 5 Strife I leave to Busie Natures, Restless Minds, Vain Humours, and Idle Fools, and rest,

Madam,   
Your faithful Friend and Servant.

###### IV.

MADAM,  
The other day was here the Lady I. O. to see me, and her three Daughters, which are call'd the three Graces, the one is Black, the other Brown, the third White, all three different coloured beauties; also they are of different features, statures and shapes, yet all three so equally handsom, that neither Judgment nor Reason can prefer one before another: Also their behaviours are different; the one is Majestical, the other Gay and Aery, the third Meek and Bashful; yet all three graceful, sweet and becoming: Also their Wits are different; the one Propounds well, the other Argues well, the third Resolves well; all which make a harmony in discourse. These three Ladies are resolv'd never to marry, which makes many sad Lovers; but whilst they were here, in comes the Lord S. C.and discoursing with them, at last he asks them, whether they were seriously resolv'd never to marry? they answered, they were resolv'd never to marry: 6 But, Ladies, said he, Consider, Time wears out Youth, and fades Beauty, and then you will not be the three young fair Graces; You say true, my Lord, answer'd one of them, but when we leave to be the young fair Graces, we shall then be the old wise Sibyls. By this answer you may perceive, that when our Sex cannot pretend to be Fair, they will pretend to be Wise; but it matters not what we pretend to, if we be really Virtuous, which I wish all our Sex may be, and rest,

Madam,  
Your very faithful Friend and Servant.

###### V.

MADAM,  
In my opinion the marriage between Sir A. G. and Mrs. I. S. is no wayes agreeable, wherefore not probable to be bless'd with a happy union, though she is likelyer to be the happier of the two; for 'tis better to have an old doting fool, than a wanton young filly; but he will be very unhappy through Jealousie, what with his Dotage, and her Freedom, which will be like fire and oyl, to set his mind on a flame, and burn out the lamp of his life: Truly, I did wonder, when I heard they were married, knowing her nature and his humour, for she loves young masculine Company, and he loves onely 7 young female Companion; so that he cannot enjoy her to himself, unless she barr her self from all other men for his sake, which I believe she will not do, for she will not bury her Beauty, nor put her Wit to silence for the sake of her Husband; for, if I be not mistaken, she will love a young Servant better than an old Husband; nay, if her Husband were young, she would prefer variety of Servants, before a single Husband, insomuch, that if she had been made, when there was but One man, as Adam, she would have done like her Grand mother Eve, as to have been courted by the Devil, and would betray her Husband for the Devil's sake, rather than want a Lover. But leaving the discourse of Jealousie, Age, Courtship, and Devils, I rest,

Madam,   
Your very faithful Fr. & S.

###### VI.

MADAM,  
In your last Letter you sent me word, that Sir F. O. was retir'd to write his own Life, for he saies, he knows no reason, but he may write his own life as well as Guzman; and since you desire my opinion of his intended work, I can onely say, that his Life for any thing I know to the contrary, hath been as evil as Guzman's, but whether his Wit be as good as Guzman's, I knoW not, yet I doubt the Worst, and to Write 8 an Evil life Without Wit, Will be but a dull and tedious Story, indeed so tedious and dull, as I believe none will take the pains to read it, unless he himself read of himself: but it is to be hoped, that he will be tir'd of himself, and so desist from his self Story. And if he do write his own Life, it will be as a masking Dolphin, or such like thing, where the outside is painted past-board or canvas, and the inside stuff'd with shreds of paper, or dirty raggs, scrap'd from dunghils: and if he set his Picture before, as a Frontispiece to his Book, it will be like an ill-favour'd masking Vizzard. But if he have any Friends, surely they will perswade him to imploy his time about something else; but some are so unhappy, as they have nothing to imploy Time with; they can waste Time, but not imploy Time; and as they waste Time, so Time wasts them. There's a saying, That men are born to live, and live to dye; but I think some are onely born to dye, and not to live; for they make small use of life, and life makes small use of them; so that in effect they were ready for the Grave, as soon as they came forth from the Womb. Wherefore if Sir F. O. go forward with his work, he will dig his Grave through the story of his Life, and his Soul-less Wit will be buried therein. But leaving his dead Wit to his paper Coffin, and his unprofitable Labours to his black mourning Ink, I rest,

Madam,  
Your faithful Fr. and S. 

---

###### VII.

MADAM,  
I Am sorry to hear, Wit is so little known and understood, that Sir W. T. should be thought Mad, because he hath more Wit than other men; indeed Wit should alwayes converse with Wit, and Fools with Fools; for Wit and Fools can never agree, they understand not one another; Wit flies beyond a Fools conceit or understanding, for Wit is like an Eagle, it hath a strong wing, and flies high and far, and when it doth descend, it knocks a Fool on the head, as an Eagle doth a Dotril, or a Woodcock, or such like Birds; and surely the world was never so fill'd with Fools, as it is in this age, nor hath there been greater Errours, or grosser Follies committed than there hath been in this age: It is not an age like Augustus Caesar's, when Wisdom reign'd, and Wit flourished, which was the cause of Plenty & Peace throughout the whole world: but in this age Debauchery is taken for Wit, and Faction for Wisdom, Treachery for Policy, and drunken Quarrels for Valour: Indeed the world is so foolishly Wicked, & basely Foolish, that they are happiest who can withdraw themselves most from it: But when I say the world, I mean the world of Men, or rather the Bodies of Men, for there doth not seem to be many Rational Souls amongst them, they 10 are Soul-less men, Bodies of men that have only Senses and Appetites, or Sensual Appetites. But you say, every Particular complains of the world, as I do in this Letter, yet None helps to mend it. Let me tell you, Madam, it is not in the power of every Particular, nor in a number, But the Chiefest persons must mend the world; viz. they that govern the world, or else the world will be out at the heels. But in some ages the world is more tatter'd and torn, than in other ages; and in some ages the world is patch'd and piec'd, but seldom new and suitable; and it is oftener in a Fools-coat than in a Grave Cassock. Wherefore leaving the motley, I rest,

Madam,   
Your faithful Friend and Servant.

###### VIII.

MADAM,  
You were pleas'd to invite me unto a Ball, to divert my Melancholy Thoughts, but they are not capable of your Charity, for they are in too deep a Melancholy to be diverted; like as bodies that are starved, and almost dying for hunger, so weak as they cannot feed, at least, that want strength to nourish or digest, having not life enough to re-inkindle the vital fire, which want of food hath neer put out. Thus, 11 Madam, I do not refuse your Charity, but I am not capable to receive it; Besides, my very outward appearance would rather be an Obstruction to your Mirth, than any Addition to your Pleasures, and for me, it would be very improper; for a grieved heart, weeping eyes, sad countenance, and black mourning garments, will not be suitable with dancing legs; In truth, my leaden Spirits have soder'd up my Joynts so stiff, that they will not move so agilly, as is requir'd in Dancing; I am fitter to sit upon a Grave, than to tread measures on a Carpet; and there is such an Antipathy in my mind to light Aires, that they would sooner stop my Ears as Discord, than enter into my Hearing as Harmony; indeed my Senses are as closed or shut from the world, and my Mind is benighted in Sorrow, insomuch as I have not one lighted thought, they are all put out with the memory of my Loss. Thus, Madam, Memory hath made an Oblivion; but though it hath buried for the present the worldly Joys of my Life, yet it hath not buried my grateful Thanks for your Favours, for which I am,

Madam,   
Your most humble S.

###### IX.

MADAM,  
In your last Letter I perceive that the Lady N. P. is an actor in some State-design, or at least would be thought so, for our Sex in this age, is ambitious to be State-Ladies, that they may be thought to be Wise Women; but let us do what we can, we shall prove our selves Fools, for Wisdom is an enemy to our Sex, or rather our Sex is an enemy to Wisdom. 'Tis true, we are full of Designs and Plots, and ready to side into Factions; but Plotting, Designing, Factions, belong nothing to Wisdom, for Wisdom never intermeddles therein or therewith, but renounces them; it is onely cheating Craft and Subtilty that are the managers thereof: and for deceiving Craft, Women are well practised therein, and most of them may be accounted Politicians; for no question but Women may, can, and oftentimes do make wars, especially Civil wars; witness our late Civil war, wherein Women were great, although not good actors; for though Women cannot fight with warring arms themselves, yet they can easily inflame men's minds against the Governours and Governments, unto which Men are too apt even without the perswasion of Women, as to make innovation through envy and emulation, in hopes of advancement in Title, Fortune and Power, of 13 which Women are as ambitious as Men; but I wish for the honour of our Sex, that Women could as easily make peace as war, though it is easier to do evil than good, for every fool can make an uproar, and a tumultuous disorder, such as the wisest can hardly settle into order again. But Women in State-affairs can do as they do with themselves, they can, and do often make themselves sick, but when they are sick, not well again: So they can disorder a State, as they do their Bodies, but neither can give Peace to th' one, nor Health to th' other; but their restless Minds, and unsatiable Appetites, do many times bring Ruin to the one, and Death to the other; for Temperance and Quietness are strangers to our Sex. But leaving the Lady N. P. to her petty Designs, and weak Plots, I rest,

Madam,   
Your very faithful Fr. and S.

###### X.

MADAM,  
In your last Letter you were pleased to tell me for news, that C. V. was newly made a Lord; truly he deserves it, and if his Title were to be measur'd, it would be far short of his Merit, but it is a greater honour to have more Merit than Title, than to have more Title than 14 Merit. Indeed Title ought to be but as a Sign; as the King's Arms or Picture to a Shop of a rich Merchandise; so Title should be but to have it known there is a worthy Person, who is full of Noble Qualities, Moral Virtues, Sweet Graces, Divine Influences, Learned Sciences, Wise Counsels, and the like, which ought to be commerced and traffick'd within the world, for their own and others good, benefit and pleasure; for the riches of the Mind must do as other riches, which is to disperse about, not to lie unprofitably hid, and horded up from all use; but they ought to be as Staple Commodities, and not as Trifles of Vanity, which wear out, or are laid by, as mens humours change, and are more for fashion than benefit. But some men seem to be richer than they are, and some to be poorer than they are; they that seem richer than they are, lay all in their outward Shops, and those that seem poorer than they are, lay all in their inward Ware-houses: Those that lay all in their outward Shops are vain-glorious Persons, those that lay all in their inward Ware-houses are magnanimous Persons; But womens Minds or Souls are like Shops of small-wares, wherein some have pretty toyes, but nothing of any great value. I imagine you will chide me for this opinion, and I should deserve to be chidden, if all Women were like to you; but you are but one, and I speak of Women, not of One woman; and thus I am neither injurious to You, nor partial to our Sex; but I wish with all my heart, our 15 whole Sex were like you, so I might hope to be one of your Copies, and though you are an example not to be pattern'd, yet I will endeavour to imitate you as much as I can, by which I may be so much the more worthy to be

Your Ladiships Humble Servant.

MADAM,  
I Hear the Lady B. A. and the lady C. D. are gone to be Courtiers, but I believe they will neither agree with the Court, nor the Court with them; for the one hath been bred fitter for a Nunnery than a Court, and the other bred to good huswifry, fitter for the Countrey than a Court; the truth is, Sparing is unnatural for a Courtier, and Praying is not usual for a Courtier, yet those Ladies that are Beautiful are made Saints there, and the men are their Devouts, which offer them Vows, Prayers, Praises, and sometimes Thanksgiving, and many times they are Penitents; but when the Ladies Beauties decay, the men become Apostates. Thus you may see many of our Sex are made Saints, though they be Sinners, but they are Sainted for theit Beauty, not for their Piety, for their outward Form, not for their inward Grace: Indeed they are worldly Saints, and the Court 16 is their Heaven, and Nature their Goddess, which indues them with attractive Graces; to which I leave them, and rest,

Madam,   
Your faithful Fr. and S.

MADAM,  
I Hear the Lady D. C. makes Politick feasts and entertainments, feasting the Courtiers, and entertaining them with dancing and carding, to whom she doth Politickly lose her mony, and causes her husband to lend them mony out of a Policy, and 'tis likely she will Politickly ruin her husband; for I believe she is more Politick with her husband than with the Courtiers, and they more Politick with her than her husband. But many wives will perswade their husbands to invite company, pretending some Designs, whenas their chief Design is, to have Company; and they will be very free and frolick with their guests, making their husbands believe they are so onely to compass, or bring their Designs to pass; so as they make their husbands Pimps to Cuckold themselves, who think their wives wise women, both in their Counsels and Actions: Such, and the like inventions and excuses wives have to be in company; and it is to be observed, that those wives that 17 love freedom and company, will be so very kind to their husbands when they bring home company, or are with such company as they like, that not onely strangers, but their husbands think them for that time the best wives in the world; whenas being all alone, to their husbands, the Furies are no more turbulent, nor worse natur'd than they; But in much company all is as their husbands please, whether to dance or play; upon which kind words and humble behaviour, their husbands are so ravish'd with joy, as then it is what their wives please; nay, they intreat their Wives to please themselves, and approve of all they say or do. Other Wives, to get, or be in company, Will insinuatingly flatter, and persWade their husbands, that they are the wisest, or wittiest men in the world, and that there is none that knows how to entertain company but they; that for their own parts they hate much company, as nothing so tedious and troublesome, and onely take delight to see their husbands entertain guests, and love to hear them discourse with strangers, their wit and behaviour being so far above others; and to encourage their husbands, or to flatter them the more, they will repeat their Discourses when they are alone together, as how well such or such a question was resolv'd, or how wittily such or such a one was answer'd, and the like; whereupon the husband often invites company, onely for his wife to hear his supreme Wit, wise Sentences, and to see his grave Entertainments, 18 whenas his wife laughs in her mind to hear what a Fool, and to see what a formal Coxcomb, and how self-conceited he is. Thus most husbands are either deluded with Politick wives, or forced to obey, or humour their Turbulent and Peevish wives, or deceived by their Insinuating and Flattering wives, to betray themselves. But fearing I should divulge too much of the nature of our Sex, I stop here, and rest,

Madam,   
Your faithful Fr. & S.
