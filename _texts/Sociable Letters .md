#### TO THE LADY MARCHIONESS OF NEWCASTLE, On her Book of EPISTLES.

When all Epistlers you have read, and seek,   
Who writ in Latin, English, French, or Greek,   
Such Woful things, as they are only fit   
To stop Mustard-pots, to this Ladie's Wit,   
Nay, were they all Alive, I Swear, I think   
They'd Burn their Books, and Throw away their Ink,   
Make Pick-Tooths of their Pens, and for their Paper,   
Only to light Tobacco, and each Taper;   
Y'have Spoil'd Commerce, Intelligencers, Trade,   
None now dares write a Letter, so Afraid   
To be thought Fools, and is the Carriers Curse,   
To find his Empty Budget, and Lank Purse,   
Nay the Post-house's Ruin'd, and will Complain,   
From their Vast Gettings now they have no Gain;   
All now by Word of Mouth, and what is spoken,   
Or Gilded Nutmegs, or each Tavern-token,   
Nick'd Sticks for Merchants, Why would you Undo  
Your self at once thus, and the whole World too?   
After my Hearty Commendations, This,   
The Style of States-men still Applauded is;  
Your Flames of Wit, this Age may think a Sin,   
A Proclamation then may call it in.

#### TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE LORD MARQUESS OF NEWCASTLE.

MY LORD,  
It may be said to me, as one said to a Lady, Work Lady, Work, let writing Books alone, For surely Wiser Women ne'r writ one; But your Lordship never bid me to Work, nor leave Writing, except when you would perswade me to spare so much time from my Study as to take the Air for my Health; the truth is, My Lord, I cannot Work, I mean such Works as Ladies use to pass their Time withall, and if I could, the Materials of such Works would cost more than the Work would be worth, besides all the Time and Pains bestow'd upon it. You may ask me, what Works I mean; I answer, Needle-works, Spinning-works, Preserving-works, as also Baking, and Cooking-works, as making Cakes, Pyes, Puddings, and the like, all which I am Ignorant of; and as I am Ignorant in these Imployments, so I am Ignorant in Gaming, Dancing, and Revelling; But yet, I must ask you leave to say, that I am not a Dunce in all Imployments, for I Understand the Keeping of Sheep, and Ordering of a Grange, indifferently well, although I do not Busie my self much with it, by reason my Scribling takes away the most part of my Time. Perchance some may say, that if my Understanding be most of Sheep, and a Grange, it is a Beastly Understanding; My answer is, I wish Men were as Harmless as most Beasts are, then surely the World would be more Quiet and Happy than it is, for then there would not be such Pride, Vanity, Ambition, Covetousness, Faction, Treachery, and Treason, as is now; Indeed one might very well say in his Prayers to God, O Lord God, I beseech thee of thy Infinite Mercy, make Man so, and order his Mind, Thoughts, Passions, and Appetites, like Beasts, that they may be Temperate, Sociable, Laborious, Patient, Prudent, Provident, Brotherly-loving, and Neighbourly-kind, all which Beasts are, but most Men not. But leaving most Men to Beasts, I return to your Lordship, who is one of the Best of men, whom God hath fill'd with Heroick Fortitude, Noble Generosity, Poetical Wit, Moral Honesty, Natural Love, Neighbourly-kindness, Great Patience, Loyal Duty, and Celestial Piety, and I pray God as Zealously and Earnestly to Bless you with Perfect Health and Long Life, as becomes

#### TO ALL PROFESSORS OF Learning and Art.

Most Famously Learned,  
I Wish I could Write so Wisely, Wittily, Eloquently, and Methodically, as might be Worthy of your Perusal; but if any of your Noble Profession should Humble themselves so Low as to Read my Works, or part of them, I pray Consider my Sex and Breeding, and they will fully Excuse those Faults which must Unavoidably be found in my Works. But although I have no Learning, yet give me leave to Admire it, and to wish I were one of your Society, for certainly, were I Emperess of the World, I would Advance those that have most Learning and Wit, by which I believe the Earth would rather be an Heaven, since both Men and Government would be as Celestial, for I am Confident that Wisdom, and for the most part Virtue, is Inherent in those that are Masters of Learning, and Indued with Wit; And to this sort of Persons I do Offer my Works, although to be Condemned on the Altar of their Censure, and rest Satisfied with the Honour that they thought them Worthy to be Iudged. Thus, whether my Works Live or Dye, I am Devoted to be

#### THE PREFACE.

Noble Readers,  
I Hope you will not make the Mistake of a Word a Crime in my Wit, as some former Readers have done, for in my Poems they found Fault that the Number was not Just, nor every Line Matched with a Perfect Rime; But I can answer for that Book, that there be but some such Errors in it, and those as it were by Chance; besides, in some Languages, as Latin and Greek, which are accounted the Chief, they regard not Rimes in their Poems, but only an Exact number of Feet and Measures; however Rimes and Numbers are only as the Garments, and not as the Body of Wit; but I have been more Exact in my other Book call'd Natural Descriptions, wherein most Verses are Just both for Number and Rimes. As for my Work, The World's Olio, they may say some Words are not Exactly Placed, which I confess to be very likely, and not only in that, but in all the rest of my Works there may be such Errors, for I was not Bred in an University, or a Free-School, to Learn the Art of Words; neither do I take it for a Disparagement of my Works, to have the Forms, Terms, Words, Numbers, or Rymes found Fault with, so they do not find Fault with the Variety of the Subjects, or the Sense and Reason, Wit, and Fancy, for I leave the Formal, or Worditive part to Fools, and the Material or Sensitive part to Wise men. Concerning my Philosophical Opinions, some did say, they were too Obscure, and not Plain Enough for their Understanding; I must confess, I writ that Book at first at the same time when I wrote my Poems, but to my Reason it was as Plain as I could write it, and if some Readers could not Understand it, I am not Nature to give them Wit and Understanding; yet have I since not only Over-viewed, and Reformed that Book, but made a great Addition to it, so that I believe, I have now so clearly Declared my Sense and Meaning therein, that those which Understand it not must not only be Irrational, but Insensible Creatures. As for my Book of Playes, some find Fault they are not made up Exactly, nor the Scenes placed Justly, as also I have not in some Playes caused all the Actors to be of an Acquaintance, but this same Fault they find, I have Express'd in one of the Epistles before that Book, which they fling back upon my Work. As for my Orations, I have heard, that some do Censure me for speaking too Freely, and Patronizing Vice too much, but I would have them not to be too Rash in Judging, but to Consider, first, whether there be a sufficient Reason that may move them to give such a Censure, for truly I am as much an Enemy to Vice, as I am a Friend to Virtue, & do Persecute Vice with as perfect an Hatred, as I do Pursue Virtue, with an Intire, and Pure Love, which is Sufficiently Known to those that Know me; and therefore, it is not out of Love to Vice that I Plead for it, but only to Exercise my Fancy, for surely the Wisest, and Eloquentest Orators, have not been Ashamed to Defend Vices upon such Accounts, and why may not I do the like? for my Orations for the most part are Declamations, wherein I speak Pro and Con, and Determine nothing; and as for that Part which contains several Pleadings, it is Fit and Lawful that both Parties should bring in their Arguments as well as they can, to make their Cases Good; but I matter not their Censure, for it would be an Endless Trouble to me, to Answer every ones Foolish Exception; an Horse of a Noble Spirit Slights the Bawling of a Petty Cur, and so do I. As for the Present Book of Letters, I know not as yet what Aspersion they will lay upon it, but I fear they'l say, they are not written in a Modestyle, that is, in a Complementing, and Romancical way, with High Words, and Mystical Expressions, as most of our Modern Letter-writers use to do; But, Noble Readers, I do not intend to Present you here with Long Complements in Short Letters, but with Short Descriptions in Long Letters; the truth is, they are rather Scenes than Letters, for I have Endeavoured under the Cover of Letters to Express the Humors of Mankind, and the Actions of Man's Life by the Correspondence of two Ladies, living at some Short Distance from each other, which make it not only their Chief Delight and Pastime, but their Tye in Friendship, to Discourse by Letters, as they would do if they were Personally together, so that these Letters are an Imitation of a Personal Visitation and Conversation, which I think is Better (I am sure more Profitable) than those Conversations that are an Imitation of Romancical Letters, which are but Empty Words, and Vain Complements. But the Reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is, first, that I have put forth Twenty Playes already, which number I thought to be Sufficient, next, I saw that Variety of Forms did Please the Readers best, and that lastly they would be more taken with the Brevity of Letters, than the Formality of Scenes, and whole Playes, whose Parts and Plots cannot be Understood till the whole Play be Read over, whereas a Short Letter will give a Full Satisfaction of what they Read. And thus I thought this to be the Best Way or Form to put this Work into, which if you Approve of, I have my Reward.

#### UPON HER EXCELLENCY THE AUTHORESS.

<l>This Lady only to her self she Writes,     
And all her Letters to her self Indites;     
For in her self so many Creatures be,     
Like many Commonwealths, yet all Agree.     
Man's Head's a World, where Thoughts are Born and Bred,      
And Reason's Emperour in every Head;      
But in all Heads doth not a Caesar Reign,    
A Wise Augustus hath not every Brain,     
<l>And Reason in some Brains from Rule's put out.      
By Mad, Rebellious Thoughts, and Factious Rout;     
And Great Disorder in such Brains will be,     
Not any Thought with Reason will Agree;     
But in her Brain doth Reason Govern well,     
Not any Thought 'gainst Reason doth Rebell,     
But doth Obey what Reason doth Command,     
When 'tis his Will, doth Travel Sea and Land,     
As some do Travel out to Kingdomes far,     
And Guided are by Observation's Star,     
They bring Intelligence from every State,     
Their Peace, their Wars, their Factions, and their Hate,     
And into every City Travel free,     
Relate their Customs, Trafficks, Policy,     
Observe each Magistrate, their Formal Face,     
And what Authority they bear, or Place,      
Whether they Covetously do Extort,     
Or are Ambitious, giving Bribes at Court,     
To Raise to Places, or to Hide their Crime,     
For thus Men do to Wealth and Office Clime;   
And some into the Churches go to see   
Who Kneels in Pray'r, or comes for Company,   
Who Courts his Mistress as his only Saint,   
Implores her Favour, and makes his Complaint   
Be Known, Or who doth turn her eyes about,   
To shew her Face, or seek a Lover out;   
And some to Balls, and Masks, and Playes do go,   
And some do Crowd to see a Pagan Shew,   
And some within Kings Courts do get a Place,   
Observe the Grandeur, and the Courtly Grace,   
The Ceremony and Splendor of a Court,   
Their Playes, Balls, Masks, and every several Sport,   
And all their Amorous Courtships which they make,   
And how the Ladies do each Courtship take,   
The Antick Postures of the Younger Race,   
Their Mimick Gestures, and Affected Pace,   
Their Amorous Smiles, and Glancing Wanton Eyes,   
All which do Noble Souls Hate and Despise;   
And some amongst the Privy-Counsel get,   
Where round a Table Prince and Nobles sit,   
Hear what they say, Observe their Cross Debates,   
And mark which speaks through Faction, or which Hates   
Some Lord that is in Favour more than he,   
For in States Matters seldom they Agree.   
And thus Her Thoughts, the Creatures of her Mind,   
Do Travel through the World amongst Mankind,   
And then Return, and to the Mind do bring  
All the Relations of each several thing;   
And Observation Guides them back again   
To Reason, their Great King, that's in the Brain:   
Then Contemplation calls the Senses straight,   
Which Ready are, and Diligently Wait,   
Commanding Two these Letters for to Write,   
Touch in the Hand, as also the Eye-sight,   
These Two the Soul's Clerks are, which do Inscribe,   
And Write all Truly down, having no Bribe.

#### TO THE CENSORIOUS READER.

- Reader, you'l think, perchance, my Wit in Fault,       
- Like Meat that's too much Brin'd, and Oversalt,     
- But better Poets far than I have been,   
Have written Sharper, and with Greater Splene,     
Yet they have much been Prais'd for writing so,     
And on Advancing Stigues of Fame do go;   
But my Poor Writings they no Malice know,   
Nor on a Crabbed Nature did they Grow;   
I to Particulars give no Abuse,   
My Wit Indites for Profitable Use,   
That Men may see their Follies, and their Crimes,   
Their Errours, Vanities, and Idle Times,   
Not that I think they do not Know them well,   
But lest they should Forget, Im' Bold to tell,   
For to Remember them, like those that Ride,   
Not thinking, on their Way, may chance to Slide,   
Or Fall into a Ditch, so I for Fear   
Bid them take Heed, Beware, and have a Care,   
For there are Stumps of Trees, or a Deep Pit,   
Or Dangerous Passages where Thieves do sit   
And Wait, or Ravenous Beasts do lye for Prey,   
Or such a Lane where's Foul and Dirty Way,   
And so of Waters, and each Dangerous place:   
But I write not to any mans Disgrace;   
Then Censure not my Satyr-wit for Crime,   
Nor putting this Epistle into Rime.

### Sociable Letters 

###### I.

MADAM,  
You were pleas'd to desire, that, since we cannot converse Personally, we should converse by Letters, so as if we were speaking to each other, discoursing our Opinions, discovering our Designs, asking and giving each other Advice, also telling the several Accidents, and several Imployments of our home-affairs, and what visits we receive, or entertainments we make, and whom we visit, and how we are entertaind, what discourses we have in our gossiping-meetings, and what reports we hear of publick affairs, and of particular Persons, and the like; so that our Letters may present our personal meetings and associatings. Truly, Madam, I take so much delight in your wise, witty, and virtuous Conversation, as I could not pass my life more pleasing 2 and delightfully; wherefore I am never better pleased, than when I am reading your Letters, and when I am writing Letters to you; for my mind and thoughts are all that while in your Company: the truth is, my mind and thoughts live alwayes with you, although my person is at distance from you; insomuch, as, if Souls die not as Bodies do, my Soul will attend you when my Body lies in the grave; and when we are both dead, we may hope to have a Conversation of Souls, where yours and mine will be doubly united, first in Life, and then in Death, in which I shall eternally be,

Madam,   
Your faithful Friend and humble Servant.

###### II.

MADAM,  
The Lady C. E. ought not to be reproved for grieving for the loss of her Beauty, for Beauty is the Light of our Sex, which is Eclips'd in Middle age, and Benighted in Old age, wherein our Sex sits in Melancholy Darkness, and the remembrance of Beauty past, is as a displeasing Dream. The truth is, a young beautiful face is a Friend, when as an old withered face is an Enemy, the one causes Love, the other Aversion: yet I am not of Mrs. U. R.'s. humour, which had 3 rather dye before her Beauty, than that her Beauty should die before her: for I had rather live with wrinkles, than die with youth; and had rather my face cloth'd with Time's sad mourning, than with Death's white hue; and surely it were better to follow the shadow of Beauty, than that Beauty should go with the Corps to the Grave; and I believe that Mrs. V. R. would do, as the tale is of a woman, that did wish, and pray she might die before her Husband, but when Death came, she intreated him to spare her, and take her Husband; so that she would rather live without him, than die for him. But leaving this sad discourse of Age, Wrinkles, Ruin and Death, I rest,

Madam,   
Your very faithful Friend, and Servant.
